			This is a JavaScript implementation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conways Game of Life</a>, a zero-player 	game that plays itself on a two-dimensional grid. The grid starts with a randomly seeded state. Then it starts evolving. There are only a few simple rules about how cells interact with each other:</section>
		
		<section>	
	 	
	
	<ol>
	    <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.</li>
	    <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
   		<li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.</li>
	    <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
			
			</ol>
		</section>	
			
<section>As the game progresses you'll start to see some repeated patterns ("organisms") emerge.</section>
